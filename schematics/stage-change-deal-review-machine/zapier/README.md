# Zapier Adapter (stage-change-deal-review-machine)

![Stage Change Deal Review Machine Diagram](../diagram.svg)

Zapier implementation for stage-change reviews with approval-gated CRM writeback.

## Artifact
- `zap.template.json`

## Format Parity
- Intent: `zap.template.json` in this folder is a reference template for build guidance, not a direct Zapier account export JSON.
- Compatibility posture: treat this artifact as design-time documentation. Zapier JSON import/export is available on Team and Enterprise plans and expects Zapier-exported JSON; this file may require manual rebuild in the Zap editor before it can be exported/imported between accounts.

## Core Flow
1. Trigger on stage-change event (webhook or Salesforce update).
2. Normalize/validate and dedupe by `event_id`.
3. Execute enrichment, scoring, and directive-alignment cogs.
4. Request approval before Salesforce mutation.
5. Branch:
- Approved: update opportunity + emit writeback event.
- Non-approved: post findings + emit findings event.
